“Hi {details["name"]},  

I hope you’re well! I noticed you have posted job openings for {details["roleType"]} roles on LinkedIn and I’d like to express my candidacy for this role. I have already applied/am planning to apply to {details["jobID"]} and would love if you are able to review my application or if you have time for a coffee chat to discuss the role and expectations and any tips you might have. I was wondering does {details["companyName"]} sponsor Canadians for internships. I also wanted to get your advise on how Canadians can break into US tech industry.

Have a great rest of your week.”
